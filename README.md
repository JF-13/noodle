## Internet of Plants 1.o
### The purpose of the project is to create a connection with your plants.

##### This project allows you to manually or automatically water and light your plant from anywhere you have an internet connection by tracking the plants temperature, exposure to light, soil humidity, air humidity, and water reservoir.

##### The repository you are in now contains the code that goes on your server and the link below points to the code we used to upload our plant data to the database from the raspberry pi.
